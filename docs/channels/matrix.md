# Matrix (plugin)

Matrix is the Matrix channel plugin for OpenClaw.
It uses the official `matrix-js-sdk` and supports DMs, rooms, threads, media, reactions, polls, location, and E2EE.

## Plugin required

Matrix is a plugin and is not bundled with core OpenClaw.

Install from npm:

```bash
openclaw plugins install @openclaw/matrix
```

Install from a local checkout:

```bash
openclaw plugins install ./extensions/matrix
```

See [Plugins](/tools/plugin) for plugin behavior and install rules.

## Setup

1. Install the plugin.
2. Create a Matrix account on your homeserver.
3. Configure `channels.matrix` with either:
   - `homeserver` + `accessToken`, or
   - `homeserver` + `userId` + `password`.
4. Restart the gateway.
5. Start a DM with the bot or invite it to a room.

Minimal token-based setup:

```json5
{
  channels: {
    matrix: {
      enabled: true,
      homeserver: "https://matrix.example.org",
      accessToken: "syt_xxx",
      dm: { policy: "pairing" },
    },
  },
}
```

Password-based setup (token is cached after login):

```json5
{
  channels: {
    matrix: {
      enabled: true,
      homeserver: "https://matrix.example.org",
      userId: "@bot:example.org",
      password: "replace-me",
      deviceName: "OpenClaw Gateway",
    },
  },
}
```

Matrix stores cached credentials in `~/.openclaw/credentials/matrix/`.
The default account uses `credentials.json`; named accounts use `credentials-<account>.json`.

Environment variable equivalents (used when the config key is not set):

- `MATRIX_HOMESERVER`
- `MATRIX_ACCESS_TOKEN`
- `MATRIX_USER_ID`
- `MATRIX_PASSWORD`
- `MATRIX_DEVICE_ID`
- `MATRIX_DEVICE_NAME`

For non-default accounts, use account-scoped env vars:

- `MATRIX_<ACCOUNT_ID>_HOMESERVER`
- `MATRIX_<ACCOUNT_ID>_ACCESS_TOKEN`
- `MATRIX_<ACCOUNT_ID>_USER_ID`
- `MATRIX_<ACCOUNT_ID>_PASSWORD`
- `MATRIX_<ACCOUNT_ID>_DEVICE_ID`
- `MATRIX_<ACCOUNT_ID>_DEVICE_NAME`

Example for account `ops`:

- `MATRIX_OPS_HOMESERVER`
- `MATRIX_OPS_ACCESS_TOKEN`

## Configuration example

This is a practical baseline config with DM pairing, room allowlist, and E2EE enabled:

```json5
{
  channels: {
    matrix: {
      enabled: true,
      homeserver: "https://matrix.example.org",
      accessToken: "syt_xxx",
      encryption: true,

      dm: {
        policy: "pairing",
      },

      groupPolicy: "allowlist",
      groupAllowFrom: ["@admin:example.org"],
      groups: {
        "!roomid:example.org": {
          requireMention: true,
        },
      },

      autoJoin: "allowlist",
      autoJoinAllowlist: ["!roomid:example.org"],
      threadReplies: "inbound",
      replyToMode: "off",
    },
  },
}
```

## E2EE setup

Enable encryption:

```json5
{
  channels: {
    matrix: {
      enabled: true,
      homeserver: "https://matrix.example.org",
      accessToken: "syt_xxx",
      encryption: true,
      dm: { policy: "pairing" },
    },
  },
}
```

Check verification status:

```bash
openclaw matrix verify status
```

Verbose status (full diagnostics):

```bash
openclaw matrix verify status --verbose
```

Bootstrap cross-signing and verification state:

```bash
openclaw matrix verify bootstrap
```

Verbose bootstrap diagnostics:

```bash
openclaw matrix verify bootstrap --verbose
```

Verify this device with a recovery key:

```bash
openclaw matrix verify device "<your-recovery-key>"
```

Verbose device verification details:

```bash
openclaw matrix verify device "<your-recovery-key>" --verbose
```

Check room-key backup health:

```bash
openclaw matrix verify backup status
```

Verbose backup health diagnostics:

```bash
openclaw matrix verify backup status --verbose
```

Restore room keys from server backup:

```bash
openclaw matrix verify backup restore
```

Verbose restore diagnostics:

```bash
openclaw matrix verify backup restore --verbose
```

All `verify` commands are concise by default (including quiet internal SDK logging) and show detailed diagnostics only with `--verbose`.
Use `--json` for full machine-readable output when scripting.

When `encryption: true`, Matrix defaults `startupVerification` to `"if-unverified"`.
On startup, if this device is still unverified, Matrix will request self-verification in another Matrix client,
skip duplicate requests while one is already pending, and apply a local cooldown before retrying after restarts.
Failed request attempts retry sooner than successful request creation by default.
Set `startupVerification: "off"` to disable automatic startup requests, or tune `startupVerificationCooldownHours`
if you want a shorter or longer retry window.

Upgrading from the previous public Matrix plugin:

- OpenClaw automatically reuses the same Matrix account, access token, and device identity when possible.
- If the previous plugin stored a Matrix room-key backup decryption key locally, startup or `openclaw doctor --fix` will import it into the new recovery-key flow automatically.
- On the next gateway start, backed-up room keys are restored automatically into the new crypto store.
- If the old plugin had local-only room keys that were never backed up, OpenClaw will warn clearly. Those keys cannot be exported automatically from the previous rust crypto store, so some old encrypted history may remain unavailable until recovered manually.
- See [Matrix migration](/install/migrating-matrix) for the full upgrade flow, limits, recovery commands, and common migration messages.

Encrypted runtime state is stored per account and per access token in
`~/.openclaw/matrix/accounts/<account>/<homeserver>__<user>/<token-hash>/`.
That directory contains the sync store (`bot-storage.json`), crypto store (`crypto/`),
recovery key file (`recovery-key.json`), IndexedDB snapshot (`crypto-idb-snapshot.json`),
thread bindings (`thread-bindings.json`), and startup verification state (`startup-verification.json`)
when those features are in use.

## Automatic verification notices

Matrix now posts verification lifecycle notices directly into the Matrix room as `m.notice` messages.
That includes:

- verification request notices
- verification ready notices (with explicit "Verify by emoji" guidance)
- verification start and completion notices
- SAS details (emoji and decimal) when available

Inbound SAS requests are auto-confirmed by the bot device, so once the user confirms "They match"
in their Matrix client, verification completes without requiring a manual OpenClaw tool step.
Verification protocol/system notices are not forwarded to the agent chat pipeline, so they do not produce `NO_REPLY`.

## Threads

Matrix supports native Matrix threads for both automatic replies and message-tool sends.

- `threadReplies: "off"` keeps replies top-level.
- `threadReplies: "inbound"` replies inside a thread only when the inbound message was already in that thread.
- `threadReplies: "always"` keeps room replies in a thread rooted at the triggering message.
- Inbound threaded messages include the thread root message as extra agent context.
- Message-tool sends now auto-inherit the current Matrix thread when the target is the same room, or the same DM user target, unless an explicit `threadId` is provided.
- Runtime thread bindings are supported for Matrix. `/focus`, `/unfocus`, `/agents`, `/session idle`, `/session max-age`, and thread-bound `/acp spawn` now work in Matrix rooms and DMs.
- Top-level Matrix room/DM `/focus` creates a new Matrix thread and binds it to the target session when `threadBindings.spawnSubagentSessions=true`.
- Running `/focus` or `/acp spawn --thread here` inside an existing Matrix thread binds that current thread instead.

### Thread Binding Config

Matrix inherits global defaults from `session.threadBindings`, and also supports per-channel overrides:

- `threadBindings.enabled`
- `threadBindings.idleHours`
- `threadBindings.maxAgeHours`
- `threadBindings.spawnSubagentSessions`
- `threadBindings.spawnAcpSessions`

Matrix thread-bound spawn flags are opt-in:

- Set `threadBindings.spawnSubagentSessions: true` to allow top-level `/focus` to create and bind new Matrix threads.
- Set `threadBindings.spawnAcpSessions: true` to allow `/acp spawn --thread auto|here` to bind ACP sessions to Matrix threads.

## Reactions

Matrix supports outbound reaction actions, inbound reaction notifications, and inbound ack reactions.

- Outbound reaction tooling is gated by `channels["matrix"].actions.reactions`.
- `react` adds a reaction to a specific Matrix event.
- `reactions` lists the current reaction summary for a specific Matrix event.
- `emoji=""` removes the bot account's own reactions on that event.
- `remove: true` removes only the specified emoji reaction from the bot account.

Ack reactions use the standard OpenClaw resolution order:

- `channels["matrix"].accounts.<accountId>.ackReaction`
- `channels["matrix"].ackReaction`
- `messages.ackReaction`
- agent identity emoji fallback

Ack reaction scope resolves in this order:

- `channels["matrix"].accounts.<accountId>.ackReactionScope`
- `channels["matrix"].ackReactionScope`
- `messages.ackReactionScope`

Reaction notification mode resolves in this order:

- `channels["matrix"].accounts.<accountId>.reactionNotifications`
- `channels["matrix"].reactionNotifications`
- default: `own`

Current behavior:

- `reactionNotifications: "own"` forwards added `m.reaction` events when they target bot-authored Matrix messages.
- `reactionNotifications: "off"` disables reaction system events.
- Reaction removals are still not synthesized into system events because Matrix surfaces those as redactions, not as standalone `m.reaction` removals.

## DM and room policy example

```json5
{
  channels: {
    matrix: {
      dm: {
        policy: "allowlist",
        allowFrom: ["@admin:example.org"],
      },
      groupPolicy: "allowlist",
      groupAllowFrom: ["@admin:example.org"],
      groups: {
        "!roomid:example.org": {
          requireMention: true,
        },
      },
    },
  },
}
```

See [Groups](/channels/groups) for mention-gating and allowlist behavior.

## Multi-account example

```json5
{
  channels: {
    matrix: {
      enabled: true,
      dm: { policy: "pairing" },
      accounts: {
        assistant: {
          homeserver: "https://matrix.example.org",
          accessToken: "syt_assistant_xxx",
          encryption: true,
        },
        alerts: {
          homeserver: "https://matrix.example.org",
          accessToken: "syt_alerts_xxx",
          dm: {
            policy: "allowlist",
            allowFrom: ["@ops:example.org"],
          },
        },
      },
    },
  },
}
```

## Target resolution

Matrix accepts these target forms anywhere OpenClaw asks you for a room or user target:

- Users: `@user:server`, `user:@user:server`, or `matrix:user:@user:server`
- Rooms: `!room:server`, `room:!room:server`, or `matrix:room:!room:server`
- Aliases: `#alias:server`, `channel:#alias:server`, or `matrix:channel:#alias:server`

Live directory lookup uses the logged-in Matrix account:

- User lookups query the Matrix user directory on that homeserver.
- Room lookups accept explicit room IDs and aliases directly, then fall back to searching joined room names for that account.
